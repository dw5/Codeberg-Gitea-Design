# Codeberg.org Design
Codeberg.org is all about Free and Open Content and Software.

Here is the place to chat about and develop Codeberg.org's visual identity and assets. This discussion originally started in [this issue](https://codeberg.org/Codeberg/Community/issues/17). The various topics and requests brought up there will be made into issues on this repo.

## Get started
Our process is the usual checkout-patch-commit-pull-request workflow. In order to play with the Codeberg.org assets, please have a look at the deployment repos:

- [Codeberg/build-deploy-gitea (the GIT web interface)](https://codeberg.org/Codeberg/build-deploy-gitea)
- [Codeberg/build-deploy-reg-server (the GIT web interface)](https://codeberg.org/Codeberg/build-deploy-reg-server)


## Submit changes
In order to submit changes, use the usual GIT commands you are accustomed to:

- Fork the repo (click on the "Fork" button). Now you can view, and edit the asset files within these repos.
- Check out the repo, make and commit your changes, push to your repo
- Create a pull request

Each of the `build-deploy` provides an overview layout of asset files (templates, icons, styles, and config) in `README.md`.
